I’m enthusiastic, self-motivated, and have a strong work ethic. I have hands-on AI modeling experience and
contributed to projects that improved banking operations and reduced fraud. My research experience includes
using advanced techniques like LDA, PCA, Auto-sklearn, and machine learning modeling with SVM, RNN,
XGBoost, YOLO, LRPNet, and AOD. I've been fortunate to receive recognition and funding for my work from
both academic and industry professionals.
